## the ache and the light

Temple stood at the kitchen sink, fingers wet, not moving. The water had gone warm and then cold, but she stayed like that, elbows slack, eyes on the backyard where the wind moved through the dry rosemary bush. She wasn't thinking exactly. More like holding herself inside a feeling she couldn't name.

The coffee had gone cold on the counter. The radio was off.

She didn't cry. Not anymore. Not often. It wasn't that she felt nothing—just that the grief had thinned into something quieter. A background ache. The kind you could walk around in, do dishes in, drive a kid to school in.

Sage had left that morning with her usual half-smile, headphones on, backpack slung loose. She was sixteen. Beautiful in that way that made Temple feel both pride and terror. Girls like Sage got seen. That had been the beginning of everything once.

She dried her hands on her jeans and turned off the tap.

The house was small but tidy. Books on the table. A jar of garlic sprouting on the windowsill. Nothing extravagant. But held together. She worked when she could—cleaning houses, odd jobs. Enough to get by. Never more than that.

She had been sober for over a decade. No heroin. No coke. No white lines on mirrors or pills swallowed like candy. Just coffee now. Sugar sometimes, in shameful handfuls. And once in a while, when she was tired enough, a thought she didn't want.

Not always dark. Sometimes just a body, pressed close. Someone pulling her hair, just a little. Sometimes a joint, slow and shared. Sometimes nothing but a memory of being wanted, and the split second before the wanting got used up.

She hated those thoughts. Or told herself she did. She'd tried to shame them out. Prayed, fasted, did the twelve steps, did therapy, EFT tapping, breathwork. She even walked labyrinths. But the thoughts stayed.

She functioned. She even laughed. But something in her was still holding its breath.

That morning, for no real reason, she put on her coat and stepped outside.

The wind had picked up. She pulled her collar close and walked. Down the street, past the grocery. Past the faded mural of the heron and the river. Past the mailbox where someone had left a broken necklace coiled like a little offering.

The church door was open.

She paused.

It wasn't an invitation. Just a fact. Wood and hinges and air.

She stepped inside.

The light filtered in through old glass, pale and green-edged. She moved to the back, sat in the third pew without looking around. Her hands rested in her lap.

She didn't come for God. That part of her had gone quiet years ago. But she liked the hush here. The way the world dropped away, just for a few minutes.

She breathed in.

Something small and unseen softened.

She didn't know it, but Peter was in the side room, watching through the crack in the door—not spying, just noticing. He would say later it was the way she sat. Like someone trying not to be seen and longing to be witnessed at the same time.

But for now, she just sat, alone in the sanctuary, letting the ache inside her stretch out and be still.

## the one who notices

Peter hadn't meant to be there. He was supposed to be in the rectory kitchen, writing thank-you notes for the last food drive, the envelopes stacked on the table like quiet reproach. But the sanctuary had better light, and sometimes he liked the stillness.

When she came in, he stayed where he was, half-hidden behind the side door, his book open but forgotten. He didn't recognize her, though he thought he'd seen her once at the corner store with a teenage girl and a bag of carrots. There had been something careful in her posture then too. Not ashamed. Just… pulled in.

She sat without pretense. No crossing herself, no leafing through the hymnal like a tourist. Just settled in, like someone who needed stillness more than ceremony.

He watched her a while, not as a priest watches a soul, but as one person sometimes watches another: aware of something fragile and honest passing through.

Eventually, he stepped into the open.

He didn't walk heavily. He didn't speak right away. She noticed him, but didn't turn. That made him like her more.

He sat two rows behind her, slightly to the side.

"You're welcome to be here," he said after a moment, voice low, without authority.

She didn't answer.

He waited.

After a while, she said, "It's quiet."

He nodded, though she wasn't looking.

She didn't move to leave, and he didn't move to get closer. There was nothing charged in the air, only a shared stillness, like two birds resting on opposite branches in the same tree.

"I'm Peter," he offered eventually.

"Temple."

A pause.

She stood up then—not abruptly, just finished. She didn't meet his eyes, but she didn't avoid them either. There was something in the way she carried herself—not guarded exactly, but resigned. As if she had learned to take her leave before being asked to.

He didn't try to stop her. Only said, "You're welcome anytime."

And she gave him the smallest nod, the kind people offer when they don't have anything to give—but still want to give something.

He watched her go, her coat a little too thin for the wind, the door creaking as it shut behind her.

He didn't know anything about her.

But he felt something—not a pull, not intrigue. Just the kind of noticing that stays in the body longer than it should.

## the space beside him

She had not meant to tell him that day.

Not in the pews. Not on a Tuesday morning when the sanctuary was empty, the smell of wax and old wood clinging to the air like a memory that didn't leave. She had just come in to drop the tea towels. She often did little things like that—quiet little things no one asked of her.

He was sitting on the edge of the dais, his long legs stretched out, dog-eared book in hand. Something about his worn collar and the way he rested his thumb in the spine—so relaxed, as if the world had never asked anything cruel of him—undid her a little.

She had never trusted men who seemed soft. It made her bones ache, a sort of warning that came from old times, too old to speak aloud.

"Reverend," she said.

"Peter," he corrected her gently, smiling without teeth, "Only the bishop calls me 'reverend,' and only when he's annoyed."

She laughed, short and rough, but honest. She always gave him honesty, even if it scraped the sides of her throat. Maybe that's why she came back, every week. Or maybe because he didn't stare too long, didn't try to fix her with his gaze like she was an ache he could soothe.

That morning the words came. They came in a hush, as if they'd been standing behind her all her life and now simply decided to step forward.

"I've done bad things," she said.

He didn't flinch.

"I know," he said, and meant it. Not just the facts, the confessions in bits she'd let drop. But the knowing that a soul can twist and twist and still be a soul.

"I've prostituted."

He looked at her. Not through her. Not around her. Not past her.

"I know."

She stood there trembling—not in shame, not in pride—but in that place in between, where a person can't tell whether they want to run or kneel.

"Come sit," he said, patting the step beside him.

She sat, not touching him, not yet. Her arms stayed crossed. Always protecting herself, even now.

He didn't rush to speak. He didn't offer understanding, or scripture, or pity. Just waited, his hands resting on his knees like a man who had nothing to prove.

Then he reached out—not quickly, not possessively—but as if it were only natural to take her hand in his.

And when his hand wrapped around hers, something inside her stopped running.

It was not romance. It was not redemption. It was not the lies of candles and sermons. It was a stillness that came from being seen and not judged, touched and not used, loved and not needed.

She didn't cry. She'd done all her crying in motel bathtubs, in gas station parking lots, in front of school principals and social workers who thought they were saints.

But she let herself lean, just a little. Her shoulder touched his arm.

And they sat like that, quiet, the dust dancing in the stained light. The old church bell outside had long since rusted into silence. But there was another sound now, softer: the sound of peace beginning to breathe.

## the breaking point

The room was dim. Not dark—just quiet, as if even the walls had learned how to hold back. Temple sat at the edge of the bed, shoulders forward, her hands clasped so tight her knuckles blanched. She wasn't crying, not yet. But something behind her ribs was starting to move.

Peter stood a few feet away, not touching her. Just watching, his face soft but not pitying.

"I don't know what to do with this," she said.

He waited.

She kept her eyes on her hands.

"I want something. Not good. Not sweet."

Still he waited.

"I want to be taken," she said, quietly. "Not hurt. But held down. Wanted. Like I used to be. Only—safe."

Her voice didn't tremble, but her body did.

Peter didn't step closer yet.

"Okay."

She looked up at him then, eyes wide—not asking for permission, but for witness.

"You can say no," she said.

"I'm not saying anything," he replied. "Except I hear you."

That did it.

The first tear fell like a betrayal. Then more. But she didn't curl in. She stayed upright, breathing through the rush of it. Her shoulders shook. Her hands stayed clenched in her lap.

Peter knelt, slowly. Not touching her. Just folding into her line of sight.

"You're not broken," he said. "You're not dangerous."

She looked away.

"You've carried things too long," he added. "That doesn't make you bad."

She breathed in, sharp. Then exhaled like it hurt.

"I don't want to be soft," she said.

"You already are," he said. "And it's not weakness."

She turned her face toward him, eyes raw.

"Will you touch me," she whispered. "Not to fix me. Just to… hold me in place."

He rose then—slowly, with purpose—and stood before her. For a moment he said nothing. Just looked at her, his eyes steady, his body still.

"Temple," he said.

She looked up, unsure.

He was already reaching for her—slowly, but without hesitation. His hand closed gently around her wrist. Not pulling. Just claiming.

She didn't move. But she didn't pull away.

Then he did pull—not asking, not demanding—just a steady pressure that said: come.

And she did.

She rose like breath being drawn, knees unsteady, her hand still in his.

He turned her by the shoulders and guided her back onto the bed. The movement was quiet but firm, like turning a page.

She lay down.

Not in fear.

Not in performance.

But in surrender.

He followed—his body over hers, not crushing, but anchoring. One hand at her hip. One at her throat, holding her there with just enough weight to remind her she wasn't floating anymore.

She closed her eyes.

He undressed her without ceremony—careful, but not hesitant. Each layer pulled away like something that had never quite belonged to her.

He looked at her—really looked—and for a second, she wanted to pull away. But then she didn't. His gaze was steady.

It felt good to be seen. And wanted.

He came over her then, his body warm and firm, and she opened to him without speaking.

And when he entered her, it was one motion. Full. Steady.

Her breath caught.

## the garden door

The mornings had changed, but slowly. Nothing abrupt. No clear line between before and after. Just a different quiet.

The kettle still whistled the same. The floor still creaked by the back door. But now there were two pairs of boots by the threshold. His coat hung next to hers, longer, heavier, smelling faintly of cedar and smoke.

Temple stood barefoot at the kitchen counter, slicing apples. The bread had already gone into the oven, and the scent of rosemary clung to the walls. She moved without hurry. Her body knew these tasks—hands that remembered hunger, remembered work, now moved like they were being trusted.

Outside, the garden waited. She'd dug it herself that first spring—turned the soil by hand while Peter read in the porch chair nearby, saying nothing, offering nothing but his nearness.

The house had surprised her. It wasn't grand, but it was generous. Thick old walls. Windows with deep sills. A fireplace that didn't pretend to be decorative. She'd brought little with her—just a few boxes and a drawer of tangled kitchen tools—but the house didn't seem to mind. It opened to her.

She liked the mornings best, when the light came low through the east windows and he hadn't yet left for the chapel. He would touch her back softly in passing—nothing suggestive, just a presence—and she would nod without turning.

Today he hadn't left yet. He was in the next room, murmuring over notes for a wedding or a eulogy or something else people needed him for.

She looked out at the garden: greens climbing, tomatoes just starting to swell. The sage plant had nearly doubled in size.

She smiled faintly. Sage. Her daughter's name, still strange in her mouth when she said it out loud. Sage was coming that weekend. She said the house felt "weird" but "peaceful." Temple knew what she meant.

Later, after he left for the day, Temple went outside. The sun was already high, bees in the lavender, the soil warm. She knelt and pressed her hands into the earth—not to weed or harvest, not for any task. Just to feel it. The weight of it. The hum.

This was not the life she'd imagined. Not in any of the church basements or borrowed couches or tense rides across state lines.

But it was the life she had chosen.

No one had asked her to prove anything here. Not Peter. Not the house. Not the rows of thyme.

Inside, the timer rang.

She wiped her hands on her apron and went back in.
